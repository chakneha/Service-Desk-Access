Regarding the production plan snapshot ticket:
The suggested approach to handle it by taking the data from Bulla_BI_Prod_post_SAP and replacing it in the Bulla_BI_Prod for the date 2025-07-20 might not work as there is a data mismatch.
The issue regarding the LoadDateTime in the table in Bulla_BI_Prod_post_SAP which is showing the current date as LoadDate even for previous Snapshot Dates is likely because we are truncating the entire table and then inserting the data again in Bulla_BI_Prod_post_SAP, whereas in Bulla_BI_Prod we are deleting data only matching that week’s snapshot date(not the entire data) every day and then inserting again only for that week.

Hi Rahul&nbsp;Verma
Please find the following SQL query I used this morning to validate the solution, I have made comment as well to help you understand, please go through it and try to understand.

select * from BI_PROD_POST_SAP.fact.ProductionPlanItemSnapshot where SnapshotDate = '2025-07-21' --please understand why we use '2025-07-21' not '2025-07-20'
 --found out the sp: [dbo].[usp_Insert_FactProductionPlanItemSnapshot] and got following source table, the goal is to check the load date of version '2025-07-21'
 select * from BI_PROD_POST_SAP.ods.MRPSnapshotWeekly where SnapshotDate = '2025-07-14' --please understand why we use '2025-07-14' now, is there anything can be repaired in the SP to get real snapshot generation date?
&nbsp;
please further compare the following two query and confirm if it can be repaired
select * from BI_PROD_POST_SAP.fact.ProductionPlanItemSnapshot where SnapshotDate = '2025-07-14'&nbsp;
